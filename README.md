## 📚 What I Learned

During this project, I deepened my understanding of:

- 🧱 Architecting scalable UIs with Jetpack Compose and Material 3  
- 🧠 Managing state and side-effects with Kotlin Flow and Compose lifecycle-aware components  
- 🎨 Leveraging Material 3 theming and typography including Google Fonts integration  
- 📦 Implementing clean architecture with layered separation of concerns (ViewModel, Repository, Room)  
- 💾 Efficiently persisting data locally using Room database with Kotlin Coroutines  
- 🧩 Using Dagger-Hilt for robust dependency injection and integrating it with Compose  
- 🛠 Utilizing Kotlin Symbol Processing (KSP) to speed up compile-time annotation processing  
- 🔧 Configuring Gradle with modern plugins and dependency management, including platform BOMs  
- 🔄 Enabling Java language desugaring for improved backward compatibility  
- 🚀 Building fully reactive Android apps using modern Jetpack libraries and best practices  

This project strengthened my understanding of building real-world Android apps from scratch using modern best practices.
